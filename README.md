# hnn-data
This repository contains the hdf5 files with saved network configurations for use with [hnn-core](https://github.com/jonescompneurolab/hnn-core).

hdf5 files in _network-configurations_ were created using [convert_params.py](dev_scripts/convert_params.py) of the hnn-core repository. 
* Source parameters are from json and param files found on the [hnn-core](https://github.com/jonescompneurolab/hnn-core/tree/master/hnn_core/param) and [hnn](https://github.com/jonescompneurolab/hnn/tree/master/param) repositories.
* The Jones 2009 model was used for the network connectivity for all files.
